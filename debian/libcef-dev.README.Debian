CEF for Debian
-------------

Even though CEF upstream only builds as a shared library (libcef.so),
it does not explicitly version its ABI (there are no versions in its soname),
and also cannot get many of its shared resources from anywhere except the same
directory as the executable. Generally, applications are expected to embed the
library and its resources; however, this is at odds with how most libraries in
Debian work, so we have to apply some workarounds.

The current recommendation for a package building against CEF in Debian is
to link with rpath $ORIGIN, and then symlink libcef.so and the resources into
the same directory as the executable. (See the upstream README for which files
you need to include, although upstream would expect you to copy the files
instead of symlinking them.)

CEF computes an ABI marker as a hash, which the Debian package exports as a
virtual Provides (e.g. libcef-abcdefab) and also puts in the shlibs file.
This makes your package automatically depend on said library package when
you link against libcef.so, which in turn means it is not possible to get ABI
skew without detecting it. However, it also means that whenever CEF changes in
an ABI-incompatible way, you will need to rebuild your package (typically using
a binary NMU) -- it's not possible to have multiple versions of libcef
installed at the same time. This is the same strategy used for non-C languages
that don't have versioned sonames.

CEF internally uses a C ABI and then has a C++ wrapper, libcef_dll_wrapper,
which is customarily built by the application, since on Windows, you need to
link debug-built executables against debug-built libcef_dll_wrapper (there
are separate debug/release C libraries, and also DLL vs. non-DLL etc.).
Since this does not apply on Debian, libcef-dev ships a prebuilt
libcef_dll_wrapper that you can use. However, in order not to interfere with
packages that expect to built the library itself, it also ships the source
code.

Debian's Chromium packages do not build nor need icudtl.dat, and thus,
CEF follows suit.
