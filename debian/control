Description: Chromium Embedded Framework
 Chromium Embedded Framework allows third-party applications to embed
 the Chromium web browser. CEF insulates the user from the underlying Chromium
 and Blink code complexity by offering production-quality stable APIs, release
 branches tracking specific Chromium releases, and binary distributions.
 Most features in CEF have default implementations that provide rich
 functionality while requiring little or no integration work from the user.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
